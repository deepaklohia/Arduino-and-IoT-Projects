(use help section of Blynk for more info)

STEP-4. Upload the code attached in "Edgent_Tubewell" folder after updating your BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID/BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME,  to Node MCU chip and Connect your device to Blynk app using Wizard on Phone. 

### MORE INFORMATION ###
How Blynk Edgent Works - its part of blynk it allows to remotely upload the code in the chip . thats a cool feature.

i am using Maker Plan of Blynk App. you can use free one just remove extra VPIN. i am using it for managing Tenants , so its reimbursed. if you are learner. ,  i would not recommend buying it.
